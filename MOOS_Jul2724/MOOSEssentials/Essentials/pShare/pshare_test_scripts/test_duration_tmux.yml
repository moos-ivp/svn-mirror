# This is a test script for a complicated interaction using pSHare when
# duration=0. In this case pShare iw required to share a variable just once
# but note that varibale may not have been subscribed to by pShare by the time 
# the share request is made, but COULD though,  be resident in the MOOSDB.  
# rgo pShare has to go and fetch that variable 


# this script can test pShares ability to practvely go and get a historic
# variable from the DB on receipt of a dynamic share request with duration=0
# It can also test a vanilla option in which it is configured to subscribe to
# to a variable then LATER told to share with duration=0
