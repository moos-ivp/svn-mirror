This mission folder is meant to be a baseline folder for the 2.680
Front Estimation lab. 

This mission is designed to support THREE modes of operation:

(1) Single machine simulation:
------------------------------
The "launch.sh" will support the launching of a simulation where both
the shoreside and all vehicle communities are running on a single
machine. For example, a single vehicle named "abe" may be launched
with time warp 10 with:

$ ./launch.sh 10

This will launch both the shoreside and two vehicle MOOS communities.

(2) Multi-machine simulation:
------------------------------
The "launch_shoreside.sh" and "launch_vehicle.sh" scripts will support
the launching of shore and vehicle communities on different machines.
This could mean multiple laptops, or more common in 2.680, a PABLO
running a vehicle simulation connected to another laptop running the
shoreside. For example:

On the shoreside machine:

$ ./launch_shoreside.sh WARP

Once this community is launched, there should be a pMarineViewer
window showing the shoreside IP address on the top bar. This should
be noted.

On the vehicle machine, e.g., PABLO:

$ ./launch_vehicle.sh WARP --shoreip=192.168.2.1 -a --sim

This will launch the vehicle named "abe", and looking for the shoreside
at the given IP address. The --sim flag launches the local vehicle
community launching uSimMarine (the vehicle simulator).

(3) Heron operation:
------------------------------
This mode is very similar to (2). As before launch the shoreside,
with no time warp, and note the IP address:

$ ./launch_shoreside.sh WARP

On the vehicle PABLO:

$ ./launch_vehicle.sh --shoreip=192.168.2.1 -g 

This will launch the vehicle named "gus", and looking for the shoreside
at the given IP address. Notes: we don't specify a WARP since robot
ops are always warp=1. We don't invoke the --sim flag since this is not
a simulation. This will result in uSimMarine not launching and iM200
launching instead. iM200 is the PABLO interface to the Heron. Finally,
we launch with one of the actual robot names:

On Evan, launch with -e
On Felix, launch with -f
On Gus, launch with -g
On Hal, launch with -h
On Ida, launch with -i
On Jing, launch with -j
On Kirk, launch with -k
On Luke, launch with -l

Note: the vehicle name is the name of the robot computer box, not
robot vehicle frame.
