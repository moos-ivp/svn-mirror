  radius; it stores a time-stamped history of recent recorded headings
  and maintains a heading average, and forms its objective function on

  a period specifying when the influence if off (lazy). It was
  conceived for use on an AUV equipped with an acoustic modem to
  periodically slow the vehicle to reduce self-noise and reduce

license  = GPL
group    = MOOS-IvP, Helm Behaviors, Core Autonomy
distro   = moos-ivp.org

synopsis = This behavior will periodically influence the depth and
  speed of the vehicle while remaining neutral at other times. The
  purpose is to bring the vehicle to the surface periodically to
  achieve some event specified by the user, typically the receipt of a
  GPS fix. Once this event is achieved, the behavior resets its
  internal clock to a given period length and will remain idle until a
  clock time-out occurs.

license  = GPL
group    = MOOS-IvP, Helm Behaviors, Core Autonomy
distro   = moos-ivp.org

synopsis = This behavior is designed to keep the vehicle at a given
  lat/lon or x,y station-keep position by varying the speed to the
  station point as a linear function of its distance to the point. The
  parameters allow one to choose the two distances between which the
  speed varies linearly, the range of linear speeds, and a default
  transit speed if the vehicle is outside the outer radius.  An
  alternative to this station keeping behavior is an active loiter
  around a very tight polygon with the Loiter behavior. This station
  keeping behavior conserves energy and aims to minimize propulsor
  use. The behavior can be configured to station-keep at a pre-set
  point, or wherever the vehicle happens to be when the behavior
  transitions into an active state.  The station-keep behavior was
  initially developed for use on a small autonomous surface
  craft. It's worth pointing out that a control system provided by a
  vehicle manufacturer, i.e., the front-seat system, may have a native
  station-keeping mode. In this case the activation of this behavior
  would be replaced by a message from the backseat autonomy system to
  invoke the station-keeping mode.

doc_url  = http://oceanai.mit.edu/ivpman/bhvs/TestFailure
license  = GPL
group    = MOOS-IvP, Helm Behaviors, Core Autonomy
distro   = moos-ivp.org

synopsis = The TestFailure behavior is used to test the helm in two
  conceivable behavior failure modes. First, it may be used to
  simulate a behavior that crashes and thereby results in the crash of
  the helm. Second, it may be used to simulate a behavior that
  consumes a sufficiently large enough amount of time so as cause the
  helm to be considered "hung" by consumers of the helm output.
  Recall that the helm is compiled, with behaviors, into a single MOOS
  application. Although some behaviors may be compiled into shared
  libraries loaded at run time, thereby not requiring a recompile, all
  behaviors do run as part of a single helm process. A crashed
  behavior results in a crashed helm. Furthermore the helm, on each
  iteration, queries each participating behavior for its input. It
  does not do this in separate threads, and there is no timeout with a
  default reply should a behavior never answer. A hung behavior
  results in a hung helm. These are architecture decisions that on one
  hand allow a substantial amount of simplicity in the helm
  implementation and debugging. Furthermore, it's not clear that a
  graceful and safe policy exists to safely handle a rogue behavior
  other than to either (a) abort the mission or (b) put the vehicle in
  the hands of a much more conservatively configured "standby"
  instance of the helm, perhaps just to get the vehicle home. This
  behavior is used to simulate both kinds of rogue behaviors, a
  behavior that crashes and a behavior the hangs. The crash is
  implemented simply with an assert(0) statement, and the hang is
  implemented with a long for-loop.

synopsis = The Waypoint behavior is used for transiting to a set of
  specified waypoint in the x-y plane. The primary parameter is the
  set of waypoints. Other key parameters are the inner and outer
  radius around each waypoint that determine what it means to have met
  the conditions for moving on to the next waypoint.  The behavior may
  also be configured to perform a degree of track-line following, that
  is, steering the vehicle not necessarily toward the next waypoint,
  but to a point on the line between the previous and next
  waypoint. This is to ensure the vehicle stays closer to this line in
  the face of external forces such as wind or current. The behavior
  may also be set to "repeat" the set of waypoints indefinitely, or a
  fixed number of times. The waypoints may be specified either
  directly at start-up, or supplied dynamically during operation of
  the vehicle. There are also a number of accepted geometry patterns
  that may be given in lieu of specific waypoints, such as polygons,
  lawnmower pattern and so on.

  IvP solver. The IvPBuild Toolbox simplifies the generation of these
  functions by providing tools that accept a finite set of parameters
  and produce syntactically valid instances of an IvP function. One
  set of utilities (the ZAIC classes) facilitate the generation of IvP
  functions in 1 dimension. Another set of utilities (the Reflector
  tools) facilitate the generation of IvP functions in (N>1)
  dimensions.

synopsis = The lib_ivpcore library contains all the classes necessary
  for representing instances of an IvP Function and an IvP Domain. An
  IvP Function is a piecewise linearly defined function defined over
  one or more uniformly discrete decision variables. Each decision
  variable in the domain also has an lower and upper bound, and the
  IvP Domain represents the collective decision space taken as the
  Cartesian product of all decision variables. For example, for marine
  surface vehicles, the decision space is typically 2D with heading and
  speed as the two decision variables. For underwater vehicles it would
  be 3D, heading, speed and depth.

  the pBasicContactMgr posts to the MOOSDB summary reports about
  known contacts,

  The contact manager may also may be configured to post alerts, i.e.,
  MOOS variables, with select content about one or more of the

synopsis = The pContactMgrV20 application is newer version to replace
  pBasicContactMgr. It is designed to be backward compatible with
  pBasicContactMgr but for ease in adoption, the user continues to
  have the option of using the earlier version. Like pBasicContactMgr,
  it deals with information about other known vehicles in its

  incoming "contact reports" which may represent information received

  This new contact manager has better suport for memory management,
  guarding against unbounded growth of contacts, using a policy for
  dropping contacts based on contact age, range, and total number
  of contacts. It also has imroved support for exclusion filters, allowing
  the user to control which types of contacts are ignored. This can be
  configured in both the contact manager and within behaviors using
  the contact manager. The exclusion filter can also be based on the
  operation region. The new contact manager also supports some swarm
  autonomy algorithms by posting configurable information about the
  set of teammates in range, and/or the closest teammate.

synopsis = The pDeadManPost application allows the user to arrange
  configured posts to the MOOSDB in the absence of another event.  The
  following are a few of the motivating scenarios:

  (1) On a shoreside community, a dead-man post can be made to trigger
  an alert when a deployed vehicle is out of contact after some period
  of time. The alert could be a posting to trigger an alarm .wav file
  or a spoken alert message through iSay.

  (2) On a surface vehicle, a dead-man post can be made to put the
  vehicle in a station-keeping mode if comms to the shoreside command
  and control goes silent for some period of time.

  (3) On an underwater vehicle, a dead-man post can be made to put the
  vehicle in a return-to-home mode if it loses updates from navigation
  beacons for some period of time.

synopsis = The pEchoVar application is a lightweight process that runs
  without any user interaction for "echoing" the posting of specified
  variable-value pairs with a follow-on posting having different
  variable name. For example the posting of FOO=5.5 could be echoed
  such that BAR=5.5 immediately follows the first posting. The
  motivation for this tool was to convert, for example, a posting such
  as GPS_X to become NAV_X. The former is the output of a particular
  device, and the latter is a de facto standard for representing the
  vehicle's longitudinal position in local coordinates.

  Flags may be configured to be posted upon each event type -
  collision, near-miss or encounter. These flags are simply MOOS
  variable and value pairs like the flags in many other MOOS
  applications and helm behaviors. For example, such a flag may be
  used to trigger an evaluation of the mission efficiency for a window
  of time around the encounter.

synopsis = The uFldNodeComms application is a tool for handling node
  reports and messages between vehicles. Rather than directly sending
  node reports and messages between vehicles, uFldNodeComms acts as an
  intermediary to conditionally pass a report or message on to another
  vehicle, where conditions may be the inter-vehicle range or other
  criteria. The assumption is that uFldNodeComms is running on a
  topside or shoreside computer, and receiving information about the
  present physical location of deployed vehicles through node reports.
  In short, uFldNodeComms subscribes for incoming node reports for any
  number of vehicles, and keeps the latest node report for each
  vehicle. On each iteration, for a each vehicle, if the node report
  has been updated, the report is published to a specially created
  MOOS variable for the other n-1 vehicles. A user-configured criteria
  is applied before publishing the new information. Typically this
  criteria involves the range between vehicles, but the criteria may
  be further involved. Often uFldNodeComms is run purely in
  simulation, but is is often used in 2.680 with surface vehicles on
  the water, to simulate the bandwidth and range communication challenges
  found underwater and in mission with greater disances between vehicles.

synopsis = The uFldObstacleSim app will simulate the posting of
  obstacles loaded from a text file, to be shared to all vehicles in
  the uField environment. The obstacle simulator may also be
  configured to periodically randomly re-generate the obstacle
  locations and sizes. The random generation considers an region of
  containment, minimum inter-obstacle range, min and max size of
  obstacles. It may also be configured to only regenerated obstacles
  with no vehicles are within the obstacle region.
                                                                
  The simulation generates information in one of two modes, (1)
  Obstacle polygons are simply published and shared to all vehicles,
  or (2) simulated sensor data, similar to Lidar points on the
  obstacle, are published and shared to the vehicles. Downstream apps
  are then left with the job of inferring the obstacle from the sensor
  data.

synopsis = The uFldScope application is a tool for collecting diverse
  sets of information regarding a field of vehicles remotely
  deployed. Suppose, for example, one is interested in monitoring, for
  each deployed vehicle, the (a) helm mode, (b) total distance
  travelled, (c) battery level, and (d) the number of times it has
  visited a certain beacon. Each piece of information may be embedded
  in one of a number of MOOS variables, perhaps along with a lot of
  other information of no concern.

  While there are several methods to scope on the above variable and
  pick out the helm mode, the goal of the uFldScope tool is to have
  this information readily visible for each vehicle perhaps alongside
  other key fields for all vehicles, in a continuously updated simple
  table.

  The assumption is that uFldScope is running on a topside computer,
  interacting with a user, and receiving information on deployed
  vehicles primarily through node reports or other summary report
  variables.

  may be used to initialize a set of variables to the MOOSDB, and
  immediately terminate itself if a quit event is included.

  Additionally, uTimerScript may be used with the following advanced
  functions:

  (1) Each entry in the script may be scheduled to occur after a
  specified amount of elapsed time.
  (2) Event timestamps may be given as an exact point in time relative
  to the start of the script, or a range in times with the exact time
  determined randomly at run-time.
  (3) The execution of the script may be paused, or fast-forwarded a
  given amount of time, or forwarded to the next event on the script
  by writing to a MOOS variable.
  (4) The script may be conditionally paused based on user defined logic
  conditions over one or more MOOS variables.
  (5) The variable value of an event may also contain information
  generated randomly.
  (6) The script may be reset or repeated any given number of times.
  (7) The script may use its own time warp, which can be made to vary
  randomly between script executions.

  In short, uTimerScript may be used to effectively simulate the
  output of other MOOS applications when those applications are not
  available.

synopsis = uXMS is a terminal-based (non GUI) tool for scoping a
  MOOSDB. Users may precisely configure the set of variables they wish
  to scope on by naming them explicitly on the command line or in the
  MOOS configuration block. The variable set may also be configured by
  naming one or more MOOS proceses on which all variables published by
  those processes will be scoped.  Users may also scope on the history
  of a single variable.

synopsis = The zaic_hdg utility launches a simple GUI rendering a
  utility function, piecewise defined, over one discrete variable. The
  pieces are formed by a few parameters provided to an instance of the
  ZAIC_HDG utility in the IvPBuild Toolbox. The GUI user has the
  ability to change the ZAIC_HDG parameters via the keyboard and watch
  the effects of these changes as the rendering of the utility
  function is updated.
